# Customer Analysis
## Problem Statement
Marketing department needs some help in focussing on the most important market segment. Instead of marketing to everyone, they need our help in identifying who our most profitable customers are. Are they married or unmarried, working or retired, premium or budget buyers etc… This will help them position things better.
## Analysis
#### Top Profitable Product:- 
Product no 4,14,16
#### Top Spending Life Stages :-
 Older Singles/Couples
#### Top Spending Premium Status :-
 Mainstream
#### Loyal Coustomer by lifestages :- 
Older Families

## Hypothesis Analysis:- 
	•	Since the p-value is significantly lower than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between customer LIFESTAGE, PREMIUM_CUSTOMER status, and their spending behavior.
	•	This means that spending behavior varies significantly across different lifestages and premium segments.
	•	Certain customer groups contribute more to revenue than others.
